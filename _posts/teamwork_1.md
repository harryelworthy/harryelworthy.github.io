title: Does teamwork work? ... maybe?
---

Hello and welcome to my blog! Iâ€™m Harry, a cyclist and a data scientist, and I love professional cycling. I'm originally a New Zealander, but I've lived in the US for the last 10 years and have become an NBA convert; and something that has has stuck out to me is the relative plethora of analytical storytelling available to a basketball fan that does not exist in any way for a cycling fan. Inspired by some of the great [thing](https://skepticalsports.com/the-case-for-dennis-rodman-guide/) I've [read](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-best-way-to-derail-an-nba-offense-make-it-waste-time/), I am keen to turn this data lens on pro cycling.

Specifically, I want to start by focusing on *teamwork*. Cycling is a team sport in a way that many sports are not: most riders are expected to sacrifice all chances they have for individual success in a race, in order to slightly improve the odds of success for another rider on their team. When a rider wins, their whole team wins; but really, they win. The 8th rider in a winning team sees very little fame or glory, even for a sport as unfamous as cycling. This should make everyone (especially the riders doing the sacrificing) wonder: is this trade-off worth it? Are these small gains for others really worth this total resignation of my own potential to win?

Every team does this, so it might seem like the answer must be yes. And there are clearly valuable ways to help your teammates: taking them to a front right before a sprint; chasing others' attacks down, or not chasing when it is your teammate off the front of the group; giving them bottles and food, helping them get back to the bunch after a crash or mechanical. 

And yet... there is a lot of sacrifice.

Not only this, but in almost every race, you can find examples of these tactics backfiring. A lead-out man boxes his teammate in, ruining his sprint.
