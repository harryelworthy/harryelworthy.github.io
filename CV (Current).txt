Work
Uber, Staff Applied Scientist, Policy and Economics – (Senior Data Scientist)        2019 - Present


I work in a cross-functional role under the chief economist focused on earner regulation and research. This has meant producing economic research for internal and external use, modeling and advising on potential large-scale changes to the business, and crafting external policy narratives around how to build optimal laws that preserve earners’ flexibility. I also frequently collaborate with product teams to implement and optimize around new regulations.
* Led numerous external-facing research projects including blog posts (1,2), reports with external consultants, and longer-term research with academic economists (1).
* Built predictive models of the business impacts of regulatory changes, leveraging my and others’ research. These are frequently used by business leaders to inform political & product strategy.
* Lead analyst for negotiations on HB2076, NYC Congestion, NYC Delivery, among other issues. Played a pivotal role in forming final outcomes, e.g. pushing for a per-trip congestion tax for rideshare & taxi in NYC over a cordon fee; securing anti-fraud measures in the NYC delivery standard. Directly negotiated with regulators and unions, virtually and in person.
* Conducted research on tipping that led to significant product changes in regulated US markets with 10M+ annual savings. 
* Applied my research to push for changes to courier dispatch in California in order to save 1M+ annually.
* Wrote an internal white paper on the impact of a US pay regulation on the business, which led to an update of internal impact estimates across the company going forward.
* Scaled my research and modeling results into Tableau and Looker dashboards used by business leaders to see earnings trends during the pandemic, and to see the potential effects of earning regulations. Built data pipelines for this purpose.
* Involved in XP design (AB, SC, Switchback) and analysis, for e.g. updates to pricing algorithms in response to regulation. Frequent auditor of potentially risky product changes.
